# MODBUS_TCP_IP_with_Arduino_STM32_W5500
As a EE492 Graduation project, we implemented MODBUS TCP/IP protocol to microcontrollers Atmega328 Arduino and STM32F4 series. We also developed a GUI in python as a Master device to communicate with microcontroller slaves. We developed our own functions based on protocol documentation and did not use any external modbus libraries.
